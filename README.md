# Tools

Simple repository for tools I use for pentesting. I usually just keep this folder in the `<HOME>/tools` directory, but if you'd like you can keep it where-ever you want to.

## Usage

To use this, simply clone the repo. Then intialize the submodules using the following command:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
